PDCN-1569#1 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A1' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1/I0) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O5=(A3*A5)+(A3*(~A5)*(~A2))+((~A3))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.
Related violations: <none>

PDCN-1569#2 Warning
LUT equation term check  
Used physical LUT pin 'A3' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.id_state[0]_i_1/I0) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A6+~A6)*((A1))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net design_1_i/spi_to_hls_0/inst/spi_slave_inst/r_miso_bit_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/spi_to_hls_0/inst/spi_slave_inst/r_miso_bit_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell design_1_i/spi_to_hls_0/inst/spi_slave_inst/r_miso_bit_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/spi_to_hls_0/inst/bram_val1_inst/ram_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/spi_to_hls_0/inst/bram_val1_inst/ram_reg/ADDRARDADDR[5] (net: design_1_i/spi_to_hls_0/inst/bram_val1_inst/Q[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/spi_to_hls_0/inst/w_bram_addr_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
